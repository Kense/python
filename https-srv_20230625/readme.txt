To set up a local HTTPS server in Python, you can use the `http.server` module along with the `ssl` module. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this:

```python
import http.server
import socketserver
import ssl

# Define the request handler class
class MyHandler(http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        self.send_response(200)
        self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/plain')
        self.end_headers()
        self.wfile.write(b'hello world!!!')

# Set the server configuration
host = 'localhost'
port = 8000
handler = MyHandler
certfile = 'server.pem'  # Path to your SSL certificate file
keyfile = 'server.key'   # Path to your SSL private key file

# Create the SSL context
ssl_context = ssl.create_default_context(ssl.Purpose.CLIENT_AUTH)
ssl_context.load_cert_chain(certfile=certfile, keyfile=keyfile)

# Create the server instance
server = socketserver.TCPServer((host, port), handler)
server.socket = ssl_context.wrap_socket(server.socket)

# Start the server
print(f"Server running at {host}:{port}")
server.serve_forever()
```

In this example, you need to provide the paths to your SSL certificate file (`certfile`) and SSL private key file (`keyfile`). You can generate a self-signed SSL certificate and private key using tools like OpenSSL.

After running this script, a local HTTPS server will start running on `https://localhost:8000`. When you access this URL in your browser or using a tool like cURL, the server will respond with "hello world!!!".

Note: Setting up a local HTTPS server with self-signed certificates is suitable for development or testing purposes. For production environments, it is recommended to obtain valid SSL certificates from trusted certificate authorities.

Also, make sure to run this code in a secure environment and consider any security implications when setting up an HTTPS server.
